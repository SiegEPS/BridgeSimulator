# Project Context & Guiding Purpose

## 🌟 Vision
<!-- described the high-level "why" of the project. What problem does it solve? What is the ultimate dream for this software? -->
This project is focused on the game of contract bridge. The goal of this project is to create a user friendly tool to allow non tech users to run bridge simulations to analyze the likely results of certain decisions. 

## 🎯 Core Objectives
<!-- Bullet points of specific, measurable goals -->
- Create an API using @redeal (https://github.com/anntzer/redeal) to simulate bridge hands that meet specified criteria
- Create a user interface to allow users to specify the criteria for the simulation
- Create logic to analyze the results of the simulation and provide insights to the user

## 👤 Target Audience / User Persona
Non technical users who want to analyze the likely results of certain bridge decisions

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles
Simplicity over complexity
Review the full context of the project throughout the process

## ✅ Scope & Non-Goals
<!-- What are we consciously NOT doing? (Helps prevent scope creep) -->
- **In Scope**: ...
- **Out of Scope**: ...

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap
<!-- Broad themes for future development -->
After the core objectives are complete, I'd like to explore using an interactive chatbot experience to help users craft simulations instead of using a form based interface.
